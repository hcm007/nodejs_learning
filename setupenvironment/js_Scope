## Variables
** local js viriables **
##### local variable example
function myFunction() {
	var carName = "Volvo";
}
##### global js variables
var carName = "Volvo";
function myFunction(){

}
** automatically global **
##### if you assign a value to a varible that has not declared , it will automatically become a global variable
myFunction();
function myFunction() {
carName = "Volvl";
}

** global variables in HTML **
##### With js, the global scope is the complete js environment. In html, the global scope is the window object, All global variables belong to the window object
##### code here use window.carName
var carName = "Volvo";

** the lifetime of js variable starts when it is declared **
** In a web browser, global varibales are deleted when you close the browser window, but remains available to new pages loaded into the same window **

# js events
** HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML element. **
** when js is used in HTML pages, js can "react" on these events. **

** HTML Events **
#### some examples of HTML events:
#1. An HTML web page has finished loading
#2. An HTML input field was changed
#3. An HTML button was clicked
** js lets u execute code when events are detected , HTML allows event handler attribute, with js code to be added to HTML elements **
##### with single quotes:
<element event='some js'>
<element event="some js">

** example onclick attribute (with code), is added to a button element: **
##### in the example below, the js code changes the content of the element with id="demo"
<button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>
##### in the next example, the code changes the content of its own element:
<button onclick="this.innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>
** js code is often several lines long, It is more common to see event attributes calling functions: **
<button onclick="displayDate()">The time is?</button>
<script>
function displayDate() {
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = Date();
}
</script>
